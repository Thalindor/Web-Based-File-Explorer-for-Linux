I developed this application for my System Programming course project.
This project allows you to view files and directories in the Linux file system through a browser and perform operations on them.
I used the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to develop the project more efficiently.
Since this is a school project, I had a limited time frame, and due to other projects I was working on, I was only able to complete the project to a certain point; some parts are still missing.

The Linux commands the user can use:
  ls
  touch
  mkdir
  chown
  cd
  rm
  echo
  cat
